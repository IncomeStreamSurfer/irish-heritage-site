        "full": "Built in the twelfth century, Kilkenny Castle was the principal seat of the Butlers, earls, marquesses and dukes of Ormond for almost 600 years. Under the powerful Butler family, Kilkenny grew into a thriving and vibrant city. Its lively atmosphere can still be felt today. The castle, set in extensive parkland, was remodelled in Victorian times. It was formally taken over by the Irish State in 1969 and since then has undergone ambitious restoration works. It now welcomes thousands of visitors a year. The central block includes a library, drawing room, nursery and bedrooms decorated in 1830s splendour. The magnificent Picture Gallery is situated in the east wing of Kilkenny Castle. This stunning space dates from the 19th century and was built primarily to house the Butler Family's fine collection of paintings.",
        "history": "Originally built by the Norman conqueror Richard de Clare (Strongbow) in 1195, Kilkenny Castle became the principal Irish residence of the powerful Butler family in 1391. The Butlers were one of the most powerful families in Ireland for nearly 600 years. The castle underwent major remodelling in the Victorian era, creating the structure visitors see today.",
        "significance": "One of Ireland's most visited heritage sites, representing nearly 800 years of Irish history from Norman conquest through Anglo-Irish aristocracy to modern Irish statehood."

Over the last few hundred years, millions have flocked to Blarney making it a world landmark and one of Ireland's greatest treasures. That might have something to do with the Blarney Stone, the legendary Stone of Eloquence, found at the top of our tower. Kiss it and you'll never be lost for words again. But Blarney is so much more than just the stone. The castle gardens are among the most spectacular in Ireland, featuring the Poison Garden, Rock Close with its ancient druid caves, woodland walks, waterfalls, a lake, and exceptional specimen trees - some the largest of their kind in Ireland.",
        "history": "The present castle is the third to be built on the site. The first was a timber structure built before 1200 AD. Around 1210, this was replaced by a stone fortification. The current castle, built by Dermot McCarthy, King of Munster, dates from 1446. The Blarney Stone was built into the battlements in 1446.",
        "significance": "One of Ireland's most popular tourist attractions, visited by millions seeking the gift of eloquence promised by kissing the Blarney Stone. The castle and gardens represent over 600 years of Irish history."

        "full": "Few places in Ireland contain more medieval buildings than the heritage town of Trim. Trim Castle is foremost among those buildings. In fact, the castle is the largest Anglo-Norman fortification in Ireland. Hugh de Lacy and his successors took 30 years to build it. The central fortification is a monumental three-storey keep. This massive 20-sided tower, which is cruciform in shape, was all but impregnable in its day. It was protected by a ditch, curtain wall and water-filled moat. Modern walkways now allow you to look down over the interior of the keep - a chance to appreciate the sheer size and thickness of the mighty castle walls. The castle is often called King John's Castle although when he visited the town he preferred to stay in his tent on the other side of the river. Richard II visited Trim in 1399 and left Prince Hal, later Henry V, as a prisoner in the castle.",
        "history": "Built by Hugh de Lacy from 1176 onwards, Trim Castle served as the principal stronghold of the Lordship of Meath. Construction took 30 years. The castle played a significant role in Irish medieval history and was used as a film location for Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' in 1994.",

        "full": "Just a short walk from Trinity College, on the way to Christchurch, Dublin Castle is well situated for visiting on foot. The history of this city-centre site stretches back to the Viking Age and the castle itself was built in the thirteenth century. The building served as a military fortress, a prison, a treasury and courts of law. For 700 years, from 1204 until independence, it was the seat of English (and then British) rule in Ireland. Rebuilt as the castle we now know in the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Dublin Castle is now a government complex and an arena of state ceremony. The state apartments, undercroft, chapel royal, heritage centre and restaurant are now open to visitors.",
        "history": "Built on the site of a Viking settlement, Dublin Castle was established in 1204 on the orders of King John. It served as the center of British administration in Ireland for over 700 years. The current buildings largely date from the 18th century Georgian reconstruction.",
