  "description": {
    "short": "Founded by Saint Ciarán in 544 AD, Clonmacnoise was one of Europe's great centers of learning, religion, and trade, featuring Ireland's finest collection of Early Christian graveslabs.",
    "full": "Clonmacnoise is one of Ireland's most important monastic sites, founded by Saint Ciarán in 544 AD on the banks of the River Shannon. For over 600 years, this 'Monastic City' flourished as a major European center of religion, learning, craftsmanship, and trade. The site includes the remains of a cathedral, 9 churches, 2 round towers, 3 high crosses, and over 700 Early Christian graveslabs - the largest collection in Western Europe. The monastery's strategic location where the River Shannon meets the ancient Eiscir Riada east-west route made it a crossroads of medieval Ireland.",
    "history": "Saint Ciarán Mac a tSaor founded the monastery in 544 AD, though he died just months later. Despite his brief tenure, Clonmacnoise grew to become one of the most important monasteries in Ireland and Europe. Between the 8th and 12th centuries, it was a thriving community of 1,500-2,000 people including monks, scholars, craftsmen, and their families. The monastery produced important manuscripts, metalwork, and stone carvings. It was raided by Vikings and Norman invaders but continued to flourish until English forces destroyed it in 1552.",
    "significance": "Clonmacnoise represents the golden age of Irish monasticism and preserves the largest collection of Early Christian graveslabs in Western Europe. The site was visited by Pope John Paul II in 1979 and remains one of Ireland's most important heritage attractions."
