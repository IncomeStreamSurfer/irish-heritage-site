  "description": {
    "short": "A magnificent Victorian mansion set in the heart of Killarney National Park, with stunning gardens, traditional farms and craft workshops showcasing Ireland's cultural heritage.",
    "full": "Muckross House, Gardens and Traditional Farms is Kerry's premier visitor attraction. This spectacular 19th century Victorian mansion stands close to the shores of Muckross Lake, one of Killarney's three lakes, famed worldwide for their splendour and beauty. As a focal point within Killarney National Park, Muckross House is the ideal base from which to explore this landscape. Built for Henry Arthur Herbert and his wife, the water-colourist Mary Balfour Herbert, the house was designed by renowned Scottish architect William Burn. Today the principal rooms are furnished in period style and portray the elegant lifestyle of the nineteenth century landowning class. In the basement, visitors can imagine the busy bustle of the servants as they went about their daily chores. The estate features spectacular gardens including the Sunken Garden, Rock Garden, and Stream Garden, developed in preparation for Queen Victoria's visit in 1861. The Traditional Farms offer a unique step back in time to 1930s and 1940s rural Ireland, with three working farms and traditional craft workshops.",
    "history": "The Herbert family completed the building of Muckross House in 1843, though this was actually the fourth house that successive generations of the Herbert family had occupied at Muckross over a period of almost two hundred years. The family originally from Wales moved to Ireland in 1665, acquiring the lands around the current Muckross estate. William Burn, the well-known Scottish architect, was responsible for the design of the current house. Building commenced in 1839 and was completed in 1843. Originally it was intended that Muckross House should be a larger, more ornate structure, but plans were altered at Mary Herbert's request. During the 1850s, the Herberts undertook extensive garden works in preparation for Queen Victoria's visit in 1861. Paths were opened through the woods, viewing platforms and seating were provided, and the variety of late-summer-flowering shrubs and flowers was increased. In 1899, after financial difficulties, Lord Ardilaun (a member of the Guinness family) purchased the Estate. In 1910, wealthy American William Bowers Bourn leased Muckross, and his daughter Maud married Arthur Rose Vincent. Her father purchased the property as a wedding gift. Between 1911 and 1932, over £110,000 was lavished on improvements to the estate. In 1932, Muckross House and its surrounding lands were generously donated to the Irish nation by Arthur Vincent, becoming Ireland's first National Park.",
    "significance": "Muckross House represents one of Ireland's finest examples of Victorian architecture and is a centerpiece of Killarney National Park, Ireland's first National Park and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The estate is fully accredited by the Museum Standards Programme of Ireland and combines historic architecture, horticultural excellence, and living history interpretation through its Traditional Farms and Craft Centre."
