The site has been occupied for over 1000 years, with a turbulent history dating back to Viking times and having undergone several sieges, battles and triumphs throughout its long history.",
    "history": "The site on which King John's Castle stands has been occupied for over 1000 years. Viking settlers established a fortified settlement on King's Island around 922 AD. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, King John of England ordered the construction of a royal castle on this strategic location overlooking the River Shannon between 1200-1210. The castle was built to command the crossing point of the Shannon and protect the newly conquered Norman settlement. The fortress features five massive drum towers and impressive curtain walls. Throughout the medieval period, the castle served as the center of English administrative and military power in the region. It endured numerous sieges during the Irish Confederate Wars in the 1640s and during the Williamite War in the 1690s. The castle underwent a major conservation and development project completed in 2013, opening a new €5.5 million visitor experience that brings together the castle's remarkable archaeology and 21st century technology.",
    "significance": "One of Ireland's best-preserved Norman castles and Limerick's signature landmark, representing over 800 years of Irish history from Viking settlement through Norman conquest to modern times. The castle is a centerpiece of Limerick's Medieval Quarter."
