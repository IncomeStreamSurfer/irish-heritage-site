  "description": {
    "short": "A stunning Victorian castle and Benedictine monastery set on 1,000 acres of mountainside in Connemara, featuring a neo-Gothic church and 6-acre Victorian walled garden.",
    "full": "Nestled in the heart of Connemara on the Wild Atlantic Way, Kylemore Abbey is a haven of history, beauty, and serenity. Originally built as a romantic Victorian castle by Mitchell Henry for his beloved wife Margaret between 1868-1871, this magnificent estate has been home to a Benedictine order of nuns for over 100 years. The Abbey welcomes visitors from around the world to embrace the magic of the 1,000-acre estate, which includes beautifully restored period rooms, a stunning neo-Gothic church, and one of Ireland's finest Victorian walled gardens.",
    "history": "Mitchell Henry, a wealthy Manchester cotton merchant, first visited Connemara on his honeymoon in 1862 and was enchanted by the landscape. He purchased the Kylemore estate and built the castle (1868-1871) as a romantic gesture for his wife Margaret. Tragedy struck in 1874 when Margaret died suddenly in Egypt. Heartbroken, Mitchell built the neo-Gothic church (1877-1881) as a testament to his love. After Mitchell's death, the estate passed through the Duke of Manchester's ownership before being purchased by the Irish Benedictine Nuns in 1920, who had fled Ypres, Belgium during World War One.",
    "significance": "Kylemore Abbey stands as Ireland's oldest Benedictine abbey and represents one of the most iconic landmarks on the Wild Atlantic Way. It is significant as a testament to Victorian innovation and romantic love, featuring advanced engineering and architecture. The restored Victorian walled garden is one of the last such gardens built in Ireland and serves as an important heritage site."
