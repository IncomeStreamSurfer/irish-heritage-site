  "description": {
    "short": "Dunluce Castle is one of Ireland's most iconic ruins, perched dramatically on a cliff edge on the Causeway Coast, with connections to the Spanish Armada and Game of Thrones.",
    "full": "Dunluce Castle stands as one of the most dramatically situated castles in Ireland, perched precariously on a cliff edge 100 feet above the crashing Atlantic waves. Built around 1500 by the McQuillan clan, the castle later became the stronghold of the powerful MacDonnell family. The site incorporates materials from the Spanish Armada ship Girona, which wrecked nearby in 1588. The castle is perhaps best known for the legend of its kitchen collapsing into the sea in 1639, along with several servants. Today, the spectacular ruins have gained new fame as a filming location for Game of Thrones, serving as inspiration for House Greyjoy's Pyke Castle.",
    "history": "Built circa 1500 by the McQuillan clan, Dunluce Castle was captured in the 1550s by Sorley Boy MacDonnell, who incorporated materials from the Spanish Armada ship Girona (wrecked 1588) into the castle's improvements. The MacDonnells established Dunluce Town in 1608, but the castle began to decline after the famous kitchen collapse of 1639. The castle was abandoned by the late 17th century and has remained a romantic ruin ever since.",
    "significance": "Dunluce Castle is one of Northern Ireland's most iconic landmarks and an important example of medieval Irish castle architecture. Its dramatic clifftop location and romantic ruins have made it one of the most photographed sites in Ireland. The castle's connection to the Spanish Armada adds to its historical significance."
