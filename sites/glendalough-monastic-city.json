  "description": {
    "short": "Glendalough is one of Ireland's most important monastic settlements, founded by St. Kevin in the 6th century in a stunning glaciated valley in County Wicklow.",
    "full": "In a stunning glaciated valley in County Wicklow, one of Ireland's most revered saints, St. Kevin, founded a monastery in the 6th century that would become one of the most famous religious centres in Europe. The foundation at Glendalough, meaning 'Valley of Two Lakes', flourished for over six centuries as a beacon of learning, spirituality, and artistic achievement. The remains of this 'Monastic City' include a superb 30-meter round tower, numerous medieval stone churches including St. Kevin's Church (known as St. Kevin's Kitchen), a cathedral, decorated Celtic crosses, and the mysterious St. Kevin's Bed - a small cave in the cliff face above the Upper Lake.",
    "history": "St. Kevin, a descendant of one of the ruling families in Leinster, was born around 498 AD. Seeking solitude, Kevin came to the remote glaciated valley of Glendalough where he initially lived as a hermit in a cave. By 545 AD he had established a monastery where disciples could live, study, and pray. The settlement grew rapidly, becoming one of the most important centres of Celtic Christianity. The monastery flourished for six centuries until it was destroyed by English forces in 1398, though it continued as a place of pilgrimage.",
    "significance": "Glendalough stands as one of the most important and best-preserved Early Medieval monastic sites in Ireland. The site's round tower, cathedral, churches, and decorated crosses represent masterpieces of Irish medieval architecture. The settlement exemplifies the Irish monastic tradition which combined deep spirituality with practical learning and artistic achievement."
