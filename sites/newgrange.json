  "description": {
    "short": "Built around 3200 BC, Newgrange is a 5,200-year-old passage tomb famous for its winter solstice illumination and spectacular prehistoric art.",
    "full": "Newgrange, also known as Brú na Bóinne, is Ireland's most famous prehistoric monument and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This massive passage tomb predates both Stonehenge and the Egyptian Pyramids by several centuries. Built around 3200 BC, the monument consists of a large circular mound covering an acre, with an inner stone passageway leading to a cruciform chamber. The tomb is most famous for its winter solstice phenomenon - for 17 minutes at dawn on the shortest days of the year (December 19-23), sunlight penetrates the roof-box and illuminates the inner chamber.",
    "history": "Constructed over 5,200 years ago by Stone Age farmers, Newgrange required an estimated 200,000 tonnes of stone and earth. The builders demonstrated sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, engineering, and art. The monument fell into disuse and became covered by earth, appearing as a large mound. It was rediscovered in 1699 and excavated in the 1960s-70s under Professor M.J. O'Kelly, who discovered the winter solstice alignment.",
    "significance": "Newgrange is one of the most important megalithic structures in Europe. Its winter solstice alignment demonstrates the astronomical knowledge of Neolithic people. The site contains the finest collection of megalithic art in Europe, including the famous triple spiral carvings. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents an outstanding example of prehistoric achievement."
